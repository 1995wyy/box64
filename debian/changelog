box86 (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduce "HotPage", to temporarily disable Dynarec on a page were writing is also occuring (can help speed up C# code)
  * Some work on Dynarec to limit the number of mutex use, and also allow smaller block to be built (for JIT'd programs)
  * Introduce BOX64_DYNAREC_STRONGMEM for the (Arm) dynarec to emulate StrngMemory Model (needed by some games, like RimWorld)
  * More functions wrapped
  * Improve speed of the custom allocator used by dynarec and Hash (speedup loading)
  * Added a workaround for streamwebhelper to not load it
  * More opcodes added
  * More wrapped libraries, including gtk2
  * Added a fix for linking box64 on system using glibc 2.34+
  * Some residual fixes on thread attribute handling
  * Better handling of app that want 32bits jumps, like unity3d/mono (thanks mogery)
  * More ARM hardware option in CMake (Phytium, NX...)
  * Added loongarch64 support (interpretor only)
  * Some fixes to elfloader
  * Added a mecanism to cancel a Dynarec block construction if it triggers a segfault (instead of a crash)
